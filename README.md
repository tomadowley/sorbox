### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1: adf
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.df
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we gradw.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and liadf
