### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

### Quick joke

Why did the developer go broke?
Because they used up all their cache.
