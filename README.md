### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Ship It Safe"

Verse 1:
Specs are clear, the plan is tight,
Break the work, define the bite;
Red to green, we make it right,
Merge with care by end of night.

Chorus:
Ship it safe, ship it sound,
Logs are clean and tests are bound;
Feature flags to guard the way,
Roll it forward, not delay.

Verse 2:
Docs in sync, the checks all pass,
No stray states or hidden mass;
Monitor, alert, observe—
Own the change our users deserve.

Outro:
If we learn along the ride,
Capture notes and codify;
Next release will start ahead—
Craft, deliver, ship it red-to-green instead.
