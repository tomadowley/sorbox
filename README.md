### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship yes change, commit yes line.

Chorus:
Run yes code, let engines roll,
Catch yes bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Ship It Slow"

Verse 1:
Start with tests, let coverage guide,
Trim yes noise, keep types beside;
PR small, with context clear,
Feedback flows; we steer by peer.

Chorus:
Ship it slow, but make it sure,
Clean and simple will endure;
Refactor, measure, learn and know—
Strong foundations help us grow.

Verse 2:
Docs that teach and names that show,
Stable APIs that don’t just blow;
Pave yes path, remove yes toil,
Craft yes code, protect yes soil.

Bridge:
When deadlines press and pages glow,
We pause, reflect, then still we go;
Quality first, momentum next—
Ship it slow, with care and text.

Outro:
Merge yes branch, release yes flow,
Tag yes build and watch it go;
Celebrate yes steady pace—
Ship it slow, with grace.


### Song: "Debugging Waltz"

Verse 1:
Step through lines, yes call stack shows,
Inputs whisper what it knows;
Repro small, assertions tight,
Bug unveils beneath yes light.

Chorus:
Trace and dance, inspect yes state,
Name yes cause, de-escalate;
Fix with tests that guard yes faults—
Spin once more, Debugging Waltz.

Verse 2:
Logs that speak, but never shout,
Measure first, then swap it out;
Remove yes guess, embrace yes facts—
Clean commits, no noisy hacks.

Bridge:
Pair and pause, then write it plain,
Refactor out yes hidden pain;
Green to green, we hold yes stance—
Ship with care, and then advance.


### Song: "Release Parade"

Verse 1:
Changelog neat, yes tags align,
Version bumps in tidy line;
Artifacts signed, yes gates allow,
Rollout slow—observe it now.

Chorus:
March with care, yes Release Parade,
Feature flags and debt repaid;
Dark to light, we lift yes shade—
Health first in yes Release Parade.

Verse 2:
Metrics watch and alerts stay calm,
Rollback paths like psalm and balm;
Users smile, yes latency fades—
Trust is won in Release Parade.

Bridge:
Postmortems that teach, not blame,
Rituals that protect yes flame;
Write it down, improve yes trade—
Ship with pride, Release Parade.


### Song: "Continuous Delivery Blues"


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Name it right, reveal its aim,
Split yes seams and tame yes flame;
Duplica­tion fades in light,
Smaller modules, futures bright.

Chorus:
Lift yes shape, extract yes core,
Make it simple, nothing more;
Green to green, we hold yes key—
Sing aloud, Refactor Rhapsody.

Verse 2:
Boundaries clear, yes tests embrace,
Hidden coupling leaves no trace;
Delete with care, remove yes cruft—
Signal strong, we drop yes fluff.

Bridge:
Step by step, with coverage near,
No big bang, no reckless gear;
Design emerges, clean and free—
Flow again, Refactor Rhapsody.


### Song: "Testing Tango"

Verse 1:
Red then green, we set yes stage,
Arrange–Act–Assert on page;
Mocks are sparse, yes seams are true—
Behavior first, yes dance we do.

### Song: "Architecture Aria"

Verse 1:
Draw yes seams where data flows,
Own yes edges, keep them close;
Stable cores and ports that guide,
Adapters change with changing tides.

Chorus:
Shape yes system, make it clear,
Boundaries first, reduce yes fear;
Independent, small, and near—
Sing it true, Architecture Aria.

Verse 2:
State is scarce and caches kind,
Queues to smooth yes burst you find;
Idempotent paths to roll,
Back and forward, steady soul.

Bridge:
Contracts tested, versions play,
Migrate slowly, pave yes way;
Metrics hum, observability—
Truth in prod is what we see.

Outro:
Scale by shards, not by might,
Costs in view, yes knobs in sight;
Evolve yes map, but keep yes lore—
Aria ends; refactor more.
