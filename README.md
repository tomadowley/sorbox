hello

Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.

Developer joke:

Another one:
How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None—that’s a hardware problem.

One more:
There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

Yet another:
A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “Can I join you?”

And finally (for now):
To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

Okay, one more:
There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

Last last one:
Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

Okay absolutely the last one:
It works on my machine.

One for the road:
There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

Encore:
I would love to change the world, but they won’t give me the source code.

Final encore (promise):
My code doesn't have bugs; it just develops random features.

Bonus track:
There’s no cloud; it’s just someone else’s computer.
