Song: "Code and Coffee"

Verse 1
Wake up, spin up, keys begin to sing,
Cursor blinking, dreams in everything.
Compile hopes, tests turn green,
Ship a little love in every string.

Chorus
Code and coffee, keep me steady,
Push and merge when you are ready.
Bits and beats in harmony,
Build a brighter binary.

Verse 2
Refactor gently, name things true,
Small commits that carry through.
Catch the edge and let it be,
Graceful fails set developers free.

Bridge
From feature flags to API calls,
We learn to dance through failing walls.
With teammates near, we find our voice,
In clean reviews we make the choice.

Outro
Close the loop and write it down,
README smiles without a frown.
On this branch we plant a tree,
For those who code after me.

Song: "Debugging Lullaby"

Verse 1
Softly step through stack and frame,
Trace the whispers, find the blame.
Watch the watchers, logs align,
Shadow bugs reveal their sign.

Chorus
Sleep, sweet process, rest your thread,
Breakpoints cradle every dread.
When the dawn meets stderr’s cry,
We’ll fix the night with reasons why.

Verse 2
Nulls and bounds, we hold them close,
Name the states we fear the most.
Guard the branches, choose the way,
Let clear intent keep night at bay.

Bridge
Between request and the reply,
Patience hums a steady why.
Signals fade, the storm grows thin,
Tests embrace and let us in.

Outro
Close the case and dim the light,
Green-lit paths replace the night.
Commit the calm, and with a sigh,
Sing the debugging lullaby.
