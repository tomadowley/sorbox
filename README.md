### Song: "Debugging Waltz"

Verse 1:
Step through lines, the call stack shows,
Inputs whisper what it knows;
Repro small, assertions tight,
Bug unveils beneath the light.

Chorus:
Trace and dance, inspect the state,
Name the cause, de-escalate;
Fix with tests that guard the faults—
Spin once more, Debugging Waltz.

Verse 2:
Logs that speak, but never shout,
Measure first, then swap it out;
Remove the guess, embrace the facts—
Clean commits, no noisy hacks.

Bridge:
Pair and pause, then write it plain,
Refactor out the hidden pain;
Green to green, we hold the stance—
Ship with care, and then advance.

### Song: "Release Parade"

Verse 1:
Changelog neat, the tags align,
Version bumps in tidy line;
Artifacts signed, the gates allow,
Rollout slow—observe it now.

Chorus:
March with care, the Release Parade,
Feature flags and debt repaid;
Dark to light, we lift the shade—
Health first in the Release Parade.

Verse 2:
Metrics watch and alerts stay calm,
Rollback paths like psalm and balm;
Users smile, the latency fades—
Trust is won in Release Parade.

Bridge:
Postmortems that teach, not blame,
Rituals that protect the flame;
Write it down, improve the trade—
Ship with pride, Release Parade.
