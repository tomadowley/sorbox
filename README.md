Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.


### Song: "Merge Melody"

Verse 1:
Branches drift and stories grow,
Rebase clean, keep history flow;
Conflicts small, we name them right,
Stage by stage, we bring in light.

Chorus:
Merge john change, review with care,
Green lights gleam and checks all share;
Main stays calm, our pace is fair—
Trust the path, merge with care.

Verse 2:
Commit snack-size, dodge bloaty dread,
No mega-PR that melts your thread;
LGTM’s cute, but tests must sing—
Ship small bits; let canaries wing.

Bridge:
Flags control the blast radius,
Rollout slow, observant, pious;
If things tilt, we roll it back,
Learning logged in postmortem track.


### Jokes: try/catch a laugh

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs.

Why do Java developers wear glasses?
Because they don't C#.
