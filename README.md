### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Binary Ballad"

Verse 1:
Bit by bit, we build the day,
Stack and heap to light our way;
Edges tamed and inputs clean,
Logic clear in paths unseen.

Chorus:
Compile hearts, link minds in flow,
From zero-one to more we know;
Guard the state, let tests embolden—
Release the build, be calm, golden.

Bridge:
When failures flicker red and bright,
We trace the call until it's right;
Refactor gently, measure slow—
Binary ballad, onward go.


### Song: "Commit Chorus"

Verse 1:
Stage the change, the diff is clear,
Names that tell and lines sincere;
Tests beside each refactor'd seam,
Green lights pulse—continue dream.

Chorus:
Add, commit, and push the way,
CI runs to keep us sane;
Merge with care, review the lore—
Ship the story, build once more.

Bridge:
When conflicts rise in tangled threads,
We read with calm, align the heads;
Rebase gently, let history soar—
Commit chorus, we explore.
