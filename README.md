Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.


### Poem: "The Pull Request"

We carve a path from change to trust,
In lines where thought and fingers dust;
A tidy diff, a story small,
A purpose clear, a mindful call.

We frame the why before the how,
Expose the seams we stitch to now;
We show the tests that hold the line,
And name the edge where faults align.

Another mind steps in with care,
To question, polish, better, share;
Together then we merge what’s best—
A quiet craft, the Pull Request.

Release is not a single leap,
But many steps both slow and deep;
With notes that teach and code that’s clear,
We ship our learning, year to year.

We leave a trail for those who come,
Breadcrumbs set in code and sum;
Names that guide, intentions shown—
So future hands aren't left alone.

A tiny hi starts every thread,
hi warms reviews where fears have spread;
We greet the change, say hi to scope—
hi opens doors to craft and hope.


### Hakui

Branches meet in light
Small diffs, clear tests, calm release
Code whispers, ship slow
