hello

Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.

### Haiku: "README Haiku"

Tests frame every step,
Tiny changes, steady flow,
Confidence accrues.

### Haiku: "Testing Garden"

Green lights softly bloom,
Failing specs reveal the truth,
Trust gathers in code.

### Haiku: "Red-Green-Refactor"

Red fails mark the path,
Green confirms the smallest step,
Refactor breathes calm.

### Haiku: "Assertion Whisper"

Assertions whisper,
Edge cases find their voices,
Quality stands firm.

### Haiku: "Fixture Dawn"

Data seeds awake,
Fixtures set the scene with care,
Bugs fade in first light.

### Haiku: "Coverage River"

Lines flow under watch,
Coverage charts where risk sleeps,
Confidence runs deep.
