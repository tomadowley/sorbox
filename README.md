# 🚀 Project Name

Welcome to the most advanced piece of software ever written (according to my mom).  
This project does... something. We think. Maybe. Probably.

## Features

- Turns coffee into code
- May or may not work on your machine
- Has a `pipeline.sql` file because data is important (sometimes)
- Comes with a `handbook.md` in case of existential crises

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run a bunch of commands until it works
3. If it doesn't work, try turning your computer off and on again

## Usage

```bash
python engine.py
# or if you prefer, just stare at the code and contemplate life
```

## FAQ

**Q: What does this do?**  
A: Yes.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: It’s ready for some kind of production. Maybe a school play.

**Q: Who wrote this?**  
A: That’s a great question.

## License

MIT, probably. Ask legal. Or just take it, we're not cops.
