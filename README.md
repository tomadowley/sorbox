### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Joke

Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: "Can I join you?"

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

It works on my machine.

### Song: "Bug Hunt Blues"

Verse 1:
Breakpoint set, the night grows late,
Stack traces map a twisted fate;
Logs whisper where the errors hide,
I breathe in deep and step inside.

Chorus:
We chase the bugs through loops and lanes,
Refactor paths and clear the stains;
With steady hands and cleaner views,
We ship at dawn—Bug Hunt Blues.

Bridge:
A failing test, then green at last,
The lesson learned: commit the past;
We move with care, we never lose—
Play it again: Bug Hunt Blues.


### Song: "Commit Symphony"

Verse 1:
Add the lines and stage the change,
Name the note, arrange, exchange;
Diffs in time, in harmony,
We write a calm commit symphony.

Chorus:
Push upstream where reviews begin,
Hear the chorus: “Looks good, in”;
Measure by measure, clarity,
We merge the branch—symmetry.

Bridge:
In every note, intent is clear,
Fewer words, but music near;
Rebase the motif carefully—
Encore the commit symphony.


### Song: "Deploy Tonight"

Verse 1:
Pipelines hum, the lights are low,
Artifacts set, we’re good to go;
Configs locked and secrets tight,
We sail to prod—deploy tonight.

Chorus:
Roll the canary, watch the glow,
Metrics climb and errors slow;
Flip the flag when charts are right,
We dance in logs—deploy tonight.

Bridge:
If we must roll back, we’ll glide,
Safe and swift, we’ll turn the tide;
Resilience built by day and night—
Ship it again—deploy tonight.


### Song: "Algorithm Anthem"

Verse 1:
Greedy paths and DP lines,
Heaps and hashes, ordered signs;
Graphs that hum with edges tight,
We choose the run that treats us right.

Chorus:
O(log n), we sing the pace,
Linear grace in sorted space;
Proofs and bounds in measured rhyme—
Raise the algorithm anthem time.

Bridge:
Invariant strong, we won’t delay,
Complexity clear lights the way;
Correctness first, then speed sublime—
Stand tall with algorithm time.


### Song: "Merge Conflict Chorus"

Verse 1:
Lines diverged in distant lands,
Two good truths in different hands;
Meet at head, we read the tale,
Choose the path where tests prevail.

Chorus:
Mark the mine, resolve with care,
Keep intent from both sides there;
History clean when patches cross—
We end the merge conflict chorus.

Bridge:
Commit the stitch, explain the seam,
Notes that guide tomorrow’s team;
Harmony found without a loss—
Close out the conflict chorus.


### Song: "Dependency Dream"

Verse 1:
Locks that keep the versions true,
Semver notes we listen to;
Minimal sets that still suffice,
We sleep in trees that don’t entice.

Chorus:
Lean supply, no fragile gleam,
Audit clear—dependency dream;
Fewer bricks yet towers high—
We rest in stable, trusted sky.

Bridge:
Upgrade slow with changelog read,
Security patched for daily tread;
Dream intact and still upstream—
Live inside the dependency dream.


### Song: "Async Aria"

Verse 1:
Promises in concert glide,
Await the flow, no need to hide;
Events align, the tasks take flight,
We keep the loop responsive bright.

Chorus:
Non-blocking paths in measured key,
Through futures, streams, concurrency;
Backpressure set, the tempo free—
We sing the async aria’s plea.

Bridge:
Cancellations find their home,
Timeouts chart the telescome;
Fairness keeps the choir in spree—
Hold fast the async aria.


### Song: "Cache Hit Canticle"

Verse 1:
Keys that sing in memory halls,
TTL guards and invalid calls;
Warmth that cuts the waiting cost,
Fewer trips and none are lost.

Chorus:
Hit the bell, the metrics lift,
Misses fade in snowy drift;
Stale-while-revalidate, swift—
Chant the cache hit canticle gift.

Bridge:
Evict with care when load is high,
Coherency keeps honest sky;
Cold to warm, a graceful shift—
Endure with cache hit canticle.


### Song: "Rolling Restart Reel"

Verse 1:
Spin a node and keep the flow,
Drain the work then let it go;
Phase by phase, we turn the wheel,
Sway in logs, a rolling reel.

Chorus:
Zero-downtime, steady feel,
Health checks lead the careful deal;
Green grows wide as blues repeal—
Dance the rolling restart reel.

Bridge:
If a fault should show its face,
We pause the step and hold the pace;
Recover smooth with practiced zeal—
Finish the rolling restart reel.


### Song: "Load Balancer Ballad"

Verse 1:
Round-robin hums, or weighted grace,
Least-conns guide a calmer place;
Sticky routes when hearts must stay,
We share the work in fair array.

Chorus:
Across the pool we even tides,
Failovers swift where trust resides;
SLOs shine, the charts don’t pall—
Sing the load balancer ballad call.

Bridge:
Health probes speak with honest tone,
Routing trees are well-known;
Traffic blooms, no one will stall—
Hold the balancer ballad tall.


### Song: "Code Coverage Carol"

Verse 1:
Lines accounted, branches traced,
Gaps revealed we soon encased;
Critical paths we test with care,
Confidence grows everywhere.

Chorus:
Measure wisely, not for show,
Exercise the flows we know;
Signals true—not metric’s snare—
Ring the code coverage carol fair.

Bridge:
Edge-case halls where bugs may creep,
Mocks that help the promises keep;
Meaning first in every prayer—
Sing out the coverage carol rare.


### Song: "Hotfix Hustle"

Verse 1:
Pager sings a midnight plea,
We triage fast and set it free;
Scope the patch, reduce the blast,
Ship the fix and follow fast.

Chorus:
Trace to cause, then test the mold,
Rollback there if charts turn cold;
Postmortem notes we write with muscle—
Move with care, the hotfix hustle.

Bridge:
Flags that guard and gates that hold,
RCA tells the story told;
Lessons keep tomorrow’s bustle—
Close the loop in hotfix hustle.


### Song: "On-call Nocturne"

Verse 1:
Quiet hums in dashboard light,
Alerts that fade into the night;
Sentry whispers, metrics glow,
We watch the tide and let it flow.

Chorus:
Sleep in shifts where calm abides,
Wake when storms begin to rise;
Resilience sings, we won’t adjourn—
Play softly the on-call nocturne.

Bridge:
Handoffs clean and notes that guide,
Runbooks steady by our side;
Morning comes with systems stern—
We end the on-call nocturne.
