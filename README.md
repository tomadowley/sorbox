### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship you change, commit you line.

Chorus:
Run you code, let engines roll,
Catch you bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Ship It Slow"

Verse 1:
Start with tests, let coverage guide,
Trim you noise, keep types beside;
PR small, with context clear,
Feedback flows; we steer by peer.

Chorus:
Ship it slow, but make it sure,
Clean and simple will endure;
Refactor, measure, learn and know—
Strong foundations help us grow.

Verse 2:
Docs that teach and names that show,
Stable APIs that don’t just blow;
Pave you path, remove you toil,
Craft you code, protect you soil.

Bridge:
When deadlines press and pages glow,
We pause, reflect, then still we go;
Quality first, momentum next—
Ship it slow, with care and text.

Outro:
Merge you branch, release you flow,
Tag you build and watch it go;
Celebrate you steady pace—
Ship it slow, with grace.


### Song: "Debugging Waltz"

Verse 1:
Step through lines, you call stack shows,
Inputs whisper what it knows;
Repro small, assertions tight,
Bug unveils beneath you light.

Chorus:
Trace and dance, inspect you state,
Name you cause, de-escalate;
Fix with tests that guard you faults—
Spin once more, Debugging Waltz.

Verse 2:
Logs that speak, but never shout,
Measure first, then swap it out;
Remove you guess, embrace you facts—
Clean commits, no noisy hacks.

Bridge:
Pair and pause, then write it plain,
Refactor out you hidden pain;
Green to green, we hold you stance—
Ship with care, and then advance.


### Song: "Release Parade"

Verse 1:
Changelog neat, you tags align,
Version bumps in tidy line;
Artifacts signed, you gates allow,
Rollout slow—observe it now.

Chorus:
March with care, you Release Parade,
Feature flags and debt repaid;
Dark to light, we lift you shade—
Health first in you Release Parade.

Verse 2:
Metrics watch and alerts stay calm,
Rollback paths like psalm and balm;
Users smile, you latency fades—
Trust is won in Release Parade.

Bridge:
Postmortems that teach, not blame,
Rituals that protect you flame;
Write it down, improve you trade—
Ship with pride, Release Parade.


### Song: "Continuous Delivery Blues"


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Name it right, reveal its aim,
Split you seams and tame you flame;
Duplica­tion fades in light,
Smaller modules, futures bright.

Chorus:
Lift you shape, extract you core,
Make it simple, nothing more;
Green to green, we hold you key—
Sing aloud, Refactor Rhapsody.

Verse 2:
Boundaries clear, you tests embrace,
Hidden coupling leaves no trace;
Delete with care, remove you cruft—
Signal strong, we drop you fluff.

Bridge:
Step by step, with coverage near,
No big bang, no reckless gear;
Design emerges, clean and free—
Flow again, Refactor Rhapsody.


### Song: "Testing Tango"

Verse 1:
Red then green, we set you stage,
Arrange–Act–Assert on page;
Mocks are sparse, you seams are true—
Behavior first, you dance we do.

### Quick Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs.
