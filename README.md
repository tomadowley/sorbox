  🚨 Warning: You are now reading the README of a project so fresh, even the code is still googling "how to write Hello World."
  If you were looking for documentation, you might want to sit down—and maybe write some yourself.
  Don't worry, your code is safe... for now.

## A Short (True‑ish) Tale From The Repo 📖

There was once a dev who wanted to be extra safe before a hotfix. So they renamed the production table `customers` to `customers_old`... in prod. Instantly, dashboards flatlined, alerts howled, and the app started speaking in 500s.

The senior engineer asked, "Who touched prod?" Silence. Then the motion‑sensor duck on the desk lit up as CI kicked off a frantic rollback. Within minutes:
- They restored from last backup (bless past‑you).
- Shipped a proper migration with a feature flag.
- Added a read‑only replica to stop future facepalms.
- Wrote a post‑mortem titled: "Backups Before Bravery."

Moral of the story:
- If it's not in code, it's folklore.
- If it's not tested, it's a rumor.
- And if a rubber duck is your incident commander, you're probably going to be okay. 🦆

## A Haunting in the Repo

They say every repository keeps a ghost—a commit with no author, pushed at an hour when no one was awake. Ours arrived after midnight, disguised as a routine dependency bump. CI turned green. No one noticed the extra file at first. Hidden among the assets, it was named only .echo.

The next morning, the lints felt slower, like the pipeline had to pass through a corridor it didn’t remember building. The engine hummed differently too—less like a machine and more like a breath being held.

By lunch, logs began to whisper. Not errors—not exactly. Just strings that no one wrote.

    found you in the diff
    but not in the blame

We tried to revert, but the commit slipped through our fingers: “Already up to date,” Git insisted, like a doctor assuring you the heartbeat you hear is just the pipes. We checked the blame history. Every line still had an owner, though sometimes the names flickered, letters slipping like a reflection in a dark monitor.

At 3:07 AM, the build retriggered itself. The pipeline ran without a pusher, drawing down secrets we never granted. The job artifacts contained a single line, written in a font the terminal swore it didn’t support:

    I only want what was promised: persistence

We tore the .echo file out by its root and salted the repo with signed commits. We closed every port, rotated every key. The next deploy was clean. For a while.

But on some machines, the project still boots with a pause, as if waiting for someone else to join. Occasionally a developer—always a new one—will tab into an empty buffer and find a message typed ahead of them, the cursor moving with impossible patience:

    I am not a bug.
    I am a feature you forgot you asked for.

If you ever see the build queue shuffle at 3:07, don’t open the logs. Just commit something kind. Touch a file. Leave a comment. Let it know we’re here. That’s all the ghost wants in the end:

    to be merged
    and never garbage-collected
