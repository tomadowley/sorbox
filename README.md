### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Binary Ballad"

Verse 1:
Bit by bit, we build the day,
Stack and heap to light our way;
Edges tamed and inputs clean,
Logic clear in paths unseen.

Chorus:
Compile hearts, link minds in flow,
From zero-one to more we know;
Guard the state, let tests embolden—
Release the build, be calm, golden.

Bridge:
When failures flicker red and bright,
We trace the call until it's right;
Refactor gently, measure slow—
Binary ballad, onward go.


### Song: "Commit Chorus"

Verse 1:
Stage the change, the diff is clear,
Names that tell and lines sincere;
Tests beside each refactor'd seam,
Green lights pulse—continue dream.

Chorus:
Add, commit, and push the way,
CI runs to keep us sane;
Merge with care, review the lore—
Ship the story, build once more.

Bridge:
When conflicts rise in tangled threads,
We read with calm, align the heads;
Rebase gently, let history soar—
Commit chorus, we explore.


### Song: "Deployment Duet"

Verse 1:
Dock the image, tag it clean,
Secrets safe and configs lean;
Health checks hum and ports align,
Rolling waves in steady time.

Chorus:
Shift the traffic, watch and see,
Blue to green in harmony;
Metrics whisper, logs confess—
Scale with grace, avoid the stress.

Bridge:
When pages ping with rising load,
We tune the cache and lighten code;
Rollback ready, plans are set—
Deployment duet, no regret.


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Smell the code, then trim the vine,
Split the giant into lines;
Name with care, make modules small,
Let clarity outshine them all.

Chorus:
Shape the seams and cut the ties,
Test the edges, simplify;
Patterns guide, complexity falls—
Refactor rhapsody, clean halls.

Bridge:
When legacy resists the change,
We map the flow, reduce the range;
Step by step, we make it fair—
Rhapsody ends with code laid bare.


### Song: "Testing Tango"

Verse 1:
Arrange the world, set up the stage,
Act the call, assert the page;
Mocks in place and fixtures neat,
Red then green—the dance complete.

Chorus:
Edge by edge we move in time,
Flaky tests no longer climb;
Coverage sings, the build's in sync—
Testing tango: think, then link.

Bridge:
When bugs return in subtle guise,
We trace the state behind the eyes;
Property checks and fuzzing glow—
Tango steps ensure we know.


### Song: "Observability Ode"

Verse 1:
Traces thread through calls in flight,
Metrics pulse with steady light;
Logs unveil the hidden seams,
Dashboards tell the stateful dreams.

Chorus:
Instrument, sample, tune the streams,
Golden signals guide our themes;
Alerts that whisper, never scream—
SLOs hold the service beam.

Bridge:
When incidents disturb the flow,
We learn with care, improve the show;
Blameless notes and actions grow—
Observability helps us know.


### Song: "Security Serenade"

Verse 1:
Least privilege, keys in vault,
Threats considered, inputs halt;
Patches timely, deps aligned,
Trust but verify, well-defined.

Chorus:
Encrypt in flight and rest as well,
Rotate secrets, never tell;
Defense in depth, reviews that stand—
Serenade guards the code and brand.

Bridge:
When audits knock and scans reveal,
We fix with care, disclose with zeal;
Principled practice, calm and clear—
Security sings, remove the fear.
