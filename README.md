### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

Developer joke:
Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Another one:
How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None—that’s a hardware problem.

One more:
There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

Yet another:
A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “Can I join you?”

And finally (for now):
To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

Okay, one more:
There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

Last last one:
Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

Okay absolutely the last one:
It works on my machine.

One for the road:
There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

Encore:
I would love to change the world, but they won’t give me the source code.

Final encore (promise):
My code doesn't have bugs; it just develops random features.
