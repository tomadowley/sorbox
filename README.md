### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Joke

Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: "Can I join you?"

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

It works on my machine.

### Song: "Bug Hunt Blues"

Verse 1:
Breakpoint set, the night grows late,
Stack traces map a twisted fate;
Logs whisper where the errors hide,
I breathe in deep and step inside.

Chorus:
We chase the bugs through loops and lanes,
Refactor paths and clear the stains;
With steady hands and cleaner views,
We ship at dawn—Bug Hunt Blues.

Bridge:
A failing test, then green at last,
The lesson learned: commit the past;
We move with care, we never lose—
Play it again: Bug Hunt Blues.


### Song: "Commit Symphony"

Verse 1:
Add the lines and stage the change,
Name the note, arrange, exchange;
Diffs in time, in harmony,
We write a calm commit symphony.

Chorus:
Push upstream where reviews begin,
Hear the chorus: “Looks good, in”;
Measure by measure, clarity,
We merge the branch—symmetry.

Bridge:
In every note, intent is clear,
Fewer words, but music near;
Rebase the motif carefully—
Encore the commit symphony.


### Song: "Deploy Tonight"

Verse 1:
Pipelines hum, the lights are low,
Artifacts set, we’re good to go;
Configs locked and secrets tight,
We sail to prod—deploy tonight.

Chorus:
Roll the canary, watch the glow,
Metrics climb and errors slow;
Flip the flag when charts are right,
We dance in logs—deploy tonight.

Bridge:
If we must roll back, we’ll glide,
Safe and swift, we’ll turn the tide;
Resilience built by day and night—
Ship it again—deploy tonight.


### Song: "Continuous Integration Caravan"

Verse 1:
Builds line up across the sands,
Lint and tests in careful hands;
Stage by stage, we roll along,
A caravan of stable song.

Chorus:
Red to green, we watch the signs,
Pipelines hum in tidy lines;
Every commit joins the clan—
Ride on with the CI caravan.

Bridge:
Artifacts stamped, results are clear,
Signals strong, no need to fear;
Steady pace, no need to plan—
We move with the CI caravan.

Pack the app with ports and creds,
Mount the volumes, keep your threads;
From dev to prod, it’s smooth and breezy,
With containers ship made easy.

Chorus:
Yo-ho, to the registry,
Pull and run with dignity;
Scaled and steady, fault’s a phantom—
Sing the container sea shanty anthem.

Bridge:
Images tagged, we chart the flow,
Layers cached, we’re good to go;
Drift through storms—our run’s not scanty—
Steer by the container sea shanty.


### Song: "Feature Flag Foxtrot"

Verse 1:
Flip a switch and dance a beat,
Roll it out in measured feet;
Guard the change, reduce the shock,
Foxtrot through the feature lock.

Chorus:
Left-right, toggle at the pace,
Gradual glow from place to place;
Risk contained, we never balk—
Groove the feature flag foxtrot walk.

Bridge:
Metrics tell us where to glide,
Flags define the safer stride;
Step by step, we sync the clock—
Finish strong, the feature foxtrot.

Verse 1:
One for fixes, two for breaks,
Three for changes larger stakes;
Keep the promise, tame the sprawl,
Versioning that says it all.

Major, minor, patch in time,
Tag the notes with gentle rhyme;
Compatibility we enthrall—
Dance the semantic valse for all.

Bridge:
Changelog clear, the meaning stays,
Users trust our careful ways;
Release with grace, avoid the brawl—
Spin the semantic version valse ball.

Pages glow with morning light,
Guides that make the journey right;

Show the why, the how, the when,
Bring the craft to every pen;
Clear and kind, we carry on—
Rise with documentation dawn.

Bridge:
When the fog begins to creep,
Docs we wrote will hold and keep;
Future teams find pathways drawn—
Stay warm in documentation dawn.

Feature steps and hotfix turns,
Merge with care where harmony burns;

Rebase smooth, no tangled string;
Conflicts bow and then forget—
Dance the branching ballet duet.

Release cuts mark time and space,
Tags applaud with measured grace;
History clear, no sharp regret—
Curtain falls on branching ballet.

Verse 1:
Scan the halls where risks reside,
Patch the flaws with prudent pride;
Rotate keys and guard the gate,
We secure and then update.

Chorus:
March in time, no time to fade,
Fixes shipped, the shields are made;
Threats retreat, their plans delayed—
Lead the security patch parade.

Audit logs and proofs we save,
Least privilege keeps data brave;
Signals strong, we’re not afraid—
Stand firm in the patch parade.

Drips of bytes that never end,
Pools that swell around the bend;
Close the doors and free the night,
Let the heap breathe clear and light.

Chorus:
Track the refs, reclaim the stream,
Profiles show the hopeful scheme;
From the depths we will repent—
Ease the memory leak lament.

Finalizers bow goodbye,
Cycles break and garbage fly;
Hold no ghosts, be diligent—
Calm the memory leak lament.

Arrange the steps, then act in line,
Assert the truth, the code’s design;
Fast and focused, tight and strong,
Unit tests that dance along.

Refactor safe, we keep it true;
Coverage lifts the team’s morale—
Spin the unit test tango hall.

Confidence in every angle—
Finish with the unit test tango.

Traces weave through spans of light,
Logs and metrics share the sight;

Cardinal truths in charts we read,
Alerts that pulse when systems bleed;
Clarity where signals flowed—
Sing the observability ode.

Bridge:
Context strong, we drill the seam,
Dashboards guide the steady team;
Root cause found along the road—
End with the observability ode.
