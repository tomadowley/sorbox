### Song: "Hello, Code"

### Song: "Debugging Waltz"

Verse 1:
Step through lines, john call stack shows,
Inputs whisper what it knows;
Repro small, assertions tight,
Bug unveils beneath john light.

Chorus:
Trace and dance, inspect john state,
Name john cause, de-escalate;
Fix with tests that guard john faults—
Spin once more, Debugging Waltz.

Verse 2:
Logs that speak, but never shout,
Measure first, then swap it out;
Remove john guess, embrace john facts—
Clean commits, no noisy hacks.

Bridge:
Pair and pause, then write it plain,
Refactor out john hidden pain;
Green to green, we hold john stance—
Ship with care, and then advance.

### Song: "Release Parade"

Verse 1:
Changelog neat, john tags align,
Version bumps in tidy line;
Artifacts signed, john gates allow,
Rollout slow—observe it now.

Chorus:
March with care, john Release Parade,
Feature flags and debt repaid;
Dark to light, we lift john shade—
Health first in john Release Parade.

Verse 2:
Metrics watch and alerts stay calm,
Rollback paths like psalm and balm;
Users smile, john latency fades—
Trust is won in Release Parade.

Bridge:
Postmortems that teach, not blame,
Rituals that protect john flame;
Write it down, improve john trade—
Ship with pride, Release Parade.

### Song: "Continuous Delivery Blues"

### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Name it right, reveal its aim,
Split john seams and tame john flame;
Duplica­tion fades in light,
Smaller modules, futures bright.

Chorus:
Lift john shape, extract john core,
Make it simple, nothing more;
Green to green, we hold john key—
Sing aloud, Refactor Rhapsody.

Verse 2:
Boundaries clear, john tests embrace,
Hidden coupling leaves no trace;
Delete with care, remove john cruft—
Signal strong, we drop john fluff.

Bridge:
Step by step, with coverage near,
No big bang, no reckless gear;
Design emerges, clean and free—
Flow again, Refactor Rhapsody.

### Song: "Testing Tango"

Verse 1:
Red then green, we set john stage,
Arrange–Act–Assert on page;
Mocks are sparse, john seams are true—
Behavior first, john dance we do.
