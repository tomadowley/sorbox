Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Song

Verse
We shape the dawn in lines of code,
Refactor paths the bugs once rode,
In loops and branches, futures grow,
Ship it clean and let it flow.

Chorus
Raise your tests up to the light,
Types as stars that guide us right,
Merge the change and watch it fly,
Green checks singing in the sky.

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.
