### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Code paths weave and names collide,
We trim the noise and simplify;
Lift the logic, make it clear,
Let future eyes find joy, not fear.

Chorus:
Refactor true, keep tests in sight,
Green lights guide us through the night;
Small, safe steps—compose, extract,
Let clarity lead every act.

Verse 2:
Coupling loosened, modules sing,
Patterns fit like perfect string;
Kill duplication, dead and gone,
Now reading code feels like a song.

Bridge:
When debt grows loud and shadows fall,
We pay it down—no hacks at all;
Design reveals the way we go,
Ship it clean and keep the flow.


### Song: "Deploy Dance"

Verse 1:
Tickets closed and builds are green,
Pipelines hum—a steady sheen;
Config locked, the secrets set,
We press the key with no regret.

Chorus:
Dance of deploy, roll out slow,
Watch the metrics rise and glow;
If a faultline starts to show,
Flip the switch and safely go.

Verse 2:
Blue to green, we swap the lane,
Traffic shifts without the pain;
Canaries sing, we watch the skies,
Health checks clear—no compromise.

Bridge:
Post-release, we learn and trace,
Blameless notes in calm embrace;
Next sprint plans, we write anew—
Ship with care and serve the crew.


### Song: "Bugfix Blues"

Verse 1:
Stacktrace screams at break of dawn,
Nulls parade across the lawn;
Repro steps in careful rows,
Git bisect points where it goes.

Chorus:
Sing the bugfix blues tonight,
Trace the path and set it right;
Red to green, the suite will show,
We squash the flake and let it go.

Verse 2:
Logs reveal the hidden seam,
Race conditions in the stream;
Lock the state and make it pure,
Deterministic, clean, secure.

Bridge:
Write the test that fails before,
Patch the code and test some more;
Docs updated, lessons saved—
Blues resolved, the path is paved.


### Song: "Scaling Sonata"

Verse 1:
Traffic climbs, shards align;
Queues absorb—backpressure fine;
Cache warmed and cold paths pruned,
Latency falls—tight and tuned.

Chorus:
Scale it out, then scale it up;
Measure first, then fill the cup;
Budgets guide each change we do—
Fast and safe, reliable too.

Verse 2:
Idempotent; retries fair,
Consistency where we declare;
CAP reminds what tradeoffs mean,
User joy stays crisp and clean.

Bridge:
Watch percentiles—tails must fall;
SLOs ring the warning call;
Autoscale, but plan ahead—
Cost and speed walk hand-in-hand.
