### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Code paths weave and names collide,
We trim the noise and simplify;
Lift the logic, make it clear,
Let future eyes find joy, not fear.

Chorus:
Refactor true, keep tests in sight,
Green lights guide us through the night;
Small, safe steps—compose, extract,
Let clarity lead every act.

Verse 2:
Coupling loosened, modules sing,
Patterns fit like perfect string;
Kill duplication, dead and gone,
Now reading code feels like a song.

Bridge:
When debt grows loud and shadows fall,
We pay it down—no hacks at all;
Design reveals the way we go,
Ship it clean and keep the flow.
