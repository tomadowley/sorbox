Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.


### Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Explanation:
In software, a "bug" is an error. The joke plays on the idea that bright lights attract insects ("bugs"), so "dark mode" keeps the bugs away—both literally and figuratively.

### Another joke

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.
