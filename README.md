### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

### Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?  
Because light attracts bugs.

Why do Java developers wear glasses?  
Because they don't C#.

Why did the developer go broke?  
Because they used up all their cache.

I told my computer I needed a break.  
It said: “No problem — I’ll go to sleep.”

How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?  
None. That’s a hardware problem.

I’d tell you a UDP joke…  
…but you might not get it.

Why did the function stop calling its friends?  
Because it had too many arguments.

There are 10 types of people in the world:  
Those who understand binary and those who don’t.

Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie  
where you are also the murderer.
