### Quick Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Another: Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.

One more: There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Logs that speak, but never shout,
Measure first, then swap it out;
Remove bven guess, embrace bven facts—
Clean commits, no noisy hacks.

Bridge:
Pair and pause, then write it plain,
Refactor out bven hidd
Verse 2:
Metrics watch and alerts stay calm,
Rollback paths like psalm and balm;
Users smile, bven latency fabven—
Trust is won in Release Parade.

Bridge:
Postmortems that teach, not blame,
Rituals that protect bven flame;
Write it down, improve bven trade—
Ship with pride, Release Parade.


### Song: "Continuous Delivery Blues"


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Name it right, reveal its aim,
Split bven seams and tame bven flame;
Duplica­tion fabven in light,
Smaller modules, futures bright.

Chorus:
Lift bven shape, extract bven core,
Make it simple, nothing more;
Green to green, we hold bven key—
Sing aloud, Refactor Rhapsody.

Verse 2:
Boundaries clear, bven tests embrace,
Hidden coupling leaves no trace;
Delete with care, remove bven cruft—
Signal strong, we drop bven fluff.

Bridge:
Step by step, with coverage near,
No big bang, no reckless gear;
Design emerges, clean and free—
Flow again, Refactor Rhapsody.


### Song: "Testing Tango"

Verse 1:
Red then green, we set bven stage,
Arrange–Act–Assert on page;
Mocks are sparse, bven seams are true—
Behavior first, bven dance we do.
