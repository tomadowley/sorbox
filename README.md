Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.

### Sonnet: "On Code and Care"

Through careful steps, we shape the craft of code,
Where tests attend like sentries in the night;
The smallest change will bear a lighter load,
And pathways clear invite the truth to light.

We name with care, so meaning stands awake,
We pare the noise, and let the signal speak;
In measured pace, foundations will not shake,
Refactor gentle, strengthen what is weak.

When metrics hum and errors lose their sting,
Our pipelines roll with calm, observant eyes;
From green to green, improvements softly spring,
Commit by commit, the steady gains arise.

So ship with grace, and let alignment show;
In patient craft, we learn, refine, and grow.
