### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Joke

Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: "Can I join you?"

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

It works on my machine.

### Song: "Bug Hunt Blues"

Verse 1:
Breakpoint set, the night grows late,
Stack traces map a twisted fate;
Logs whisper where the errors hide,
I breathe in deep and step inside.

Chorus:
We chase the bugs through loops and lanes,
Refactor paths and clear the stains;
With steady hands and cleaner views,
We ship at dawn—Bug Hunt Blues.

Bridge:
A failing test, then green at last,
The lesson learned: commit the past;
We move with care, we never lose—
Play it again: Bug Hunt Blues.


### Song: "Commit Symphony"

Verse 1:
Add the lines and stage the change,
Name the note, arrange, exchange;
Diffs in time, in harmony,
We write a calm commit symphony.

Chorus:
Push upstream where reviews begin,
Hear the chorus: “Looks good, in”;
Measure by measure, clarity,
We merge the branch—symmetry.

Bridge:
In every note, intent is clear,
Fewer words, but music near;
Rebase the motif carefully—
Encore the commit symphony.


### Song: "Deploy Tonight"

Verse 1:
Pipelines hum, the lights are low,
Artifacts set, we’re good to go;
Configs locked and secrets tight,
We sail to prod—deploy tonight.

Chorus:
Roll the canary, watch the glow,
Metrics climb and errors slow;
Flip the flag when charts are right,
We dance in logs—deploy tonight.

Bridge:
If we must roll back, we’ll glide,
Safe and swift, we’ll turn the tide;
Resilience built by day and night—
Ship it again—deploy tonight.
