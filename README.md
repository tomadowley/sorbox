Song: "Code and Coffee"

Verse 1
Wake up, spin up, keys begin to sing,
Cursor blinking, dreams in everything.
Compile hopes, tests turn green,
Ship a little love in every string.

Chorus
Code and coffee, keep me steady,
Push and merge when you are ready.
Bits and beats in harmony,
Build a brighter binary.

Verse 2
Refactor gently, name things true,
Small commits that carry through.
Catch the edge and let it be,
Graceful fails set developers free.

Bridge
From feature flags to API calls,
We learn to dance through failing walls.
With teammates near, we find our voice,
In clean reviews we make the choice.

Outro
Close the loop and write it down,
README smiles without a frown.
On this branch we plant a tree,
For those who code after me.
