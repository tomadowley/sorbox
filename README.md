hello

Haiku

Silent code flows light
Types and tests guard each edge
Bugs fade into night

Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Sheep Joke

Why did the sheep stop coding? Because it kept getting into an infinite baa-loop.

Song

Dev Song

Push the code and watch it fly,
Tests turn green, we breathe a sigh,
Refactors hum in midnight glow,
Ship it clean, then off we go.

Chorus:
Sing commit by commit, line by line,
Keep the diff small, crisp, and fine,
From TODOs to done, we cross the sea,
With types as sails and bugs set free.

### Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Another one: There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

And another: A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “May I join you?”

Finally: To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

One more: There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.

Yet another: There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

One last one (for now): Commit messages are like jokes—if you have to explain them, it’s not good.

Okay fine, one more: “It works on my machine” is the new “Check engine” light.

And truly the last: I’d tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

Bonus: Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

Encore: Why do Python devs wear glasses? Because they can’t C.

One for the road: My code doesn’t have bugs; it just develops random features.

Couldn't resist: There are two kinds of people: those who can extrapolate from incomplete data

One tiny async one: I’ll tell you later.

New one: Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes.

Extra: Hardware is the part of a computer you can kick.
