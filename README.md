### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.

Another one: There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

And another: A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “May I join you?”

Finally: To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

One more: There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.

Yet another: There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.

One last one (for now): Commit messages are like jokes—if you have to explain them, it’s not good.
