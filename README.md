### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship yang change, commit yang line.

Chorus:
Run yang code, let engines roll,
Catch yang bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

### Song: "Ship It Slow"

Verse 1:
Start with tests, let coverage guide,
Trim yang noise, keep types beside;
PR small, with context clear,
Feedback flows; we steer by peer.
