### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

### Quick joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?  
Because light attracts bugs.

### Another quick joke

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks:  
"Can I join you?"

### Yet another quick joke

There are only 10 kinds of people in the world:  
Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

### One more quick joke

I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

### Final quick joke

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

### Bonus quick joke

There are two hard things in computer science:  
cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.
