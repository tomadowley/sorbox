### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship yang change, commit yang line.

Chorus:
Run yang code, let engines roll,
Catch yang bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.

### Song: "Ship It Slow"

Verse 1:
Start with tests, let coverage guide,
Trim yang noise, keep types beside;
PR small, with context clear,
Feedback flows; we steer by peer.

Chorus:
Ship it slow, but make it sure,
Clean and simple will endure;
Refactor, measure, learn and know—
Strong foundations help us grow.

Verse 2:
Docs that teach and names that show,
Stable APIs that don’t just blow;
Pave yang path, remove yang toil,
Craft yang code, protect yang soil.

Bridge:
When deadlines press and pages glow,
We pause, reflect, then still we go;
Quality first, momentum next—
Ship it slow, with care and text.

Outro:
Merge yang branch, release yang flow,
Tag yang build and watch it go;
Celebrate yang steady pace—
Ship it slow, with grace.

### Song: "Debugging Waltz"

Verse 1:
Step through lines, yang call stack shows,
Inputs whisper what it knows;
Repro small, assertions tight,
Bug unveils beneath yang light.

Chorus:
Trace and dance, inspect yang state,
Name yang cause, de-escalate;
Fix with tests that guard yang faults—
Spin once more, Debugging Waltz.

Verse 2:

Mocks are sparse, yang seams are true—
Behavior first, yang dance we do.
