### Song: "Hello, Code"

Verse 1:
Hello, world — we start anew,
Type by type, and through and through;
Functions sing and tests align,
Ship the change, commit the line.

Chorus:
Run the code, let engines roll,
Catch the bugs and make it whole;
From README’s hum to prod’s bright glow,
We iterate, we learn, we grow.

Bridge:
In every diff, a tale we write,
Small steps forward, clean and light;
Review, refine, and then we show—
Hello, code; we’re good to go.


### Song: "Refactor Rhapsody"

Verse 1:
Names made clear, the purpose shows,
Prune the branches, dead code goes;
Tests in green, we press ahead,
Change is small and well‑bred.

Chorus:
Lift and shift, extract and flow,
Make it simple, make it so;
Readability before the speed,
Clarity is what we need.

Verse 2:
Coupling low and cohesion tight,
Edges handled, futures bright;
Docs that teach the how and why,
Ship with pride and keep it dry.

Outro:
When the pager starts to ring,
Calm and careful, tighten string;
Roll it back or roll it on,
Strong foundations carry on.
